# WGAN for human face generation

Description: This project employs a Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) architecture to transform random noise into
realistic human faces. Implemented using PyTorch, the project involves the design and training of a generator and a
critic using the Large-scale CelebFaces Attributes (CelebA) dataset. To enhance monitoring of losses and results
throughout the project, we integrated the Weights & Biases platform available at wandb.ai.

Note: this repository and its README will be completed over time.
